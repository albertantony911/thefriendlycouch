            <p>Hi! To begin with, we at The Friendly Couch, think it’s great that you decided to take up therapy and acknowledge your
                feelings. Not many people are able to make this decision and we are proud of you (we hope you’re proud of yourself
                for this too!)<br><br> A consent form will be shared with you by your psychologist before the therapy process begins.
                Signing the consent form means that we are taking your permission to work as your therapy provider to help you get
                better. The policies mentioned on this website or the consent form may be subject to change without prior notice.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Mental Health Services</h2>
            <p>We will be providing "therapy/counselling" to you using an eclectic approach. This means that we do not use only one
                approach towards therapy as we recognize that different people may need different techniques and methodologies to
                feel better. We are open to feedback and encourage you to tell us in case something makes you uncomfortable.<br><br> We will
                not be able to provide you "support" (any communication over calls/text) in a "crisis" (self-harm/emergency/harmful
                situation). Our services are limited to the one (1) hour of sessions we take. The booking of appointment slots is
                done via messages outside of these sessions.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Appointments and Cancellations</h2>
            <p>Payment for all sessions has to be made in advance within 12 hours of deciding the slot to confirm the session.<br><br> If
                payment isn't made in advance, the slot is liable to be assigned to someone else who has completed the payment
                within time.<br><br> We accept payment via all UPI apps such as GPay, PayTM, PhonePe as well as direct bank transfer.<br><br> We
                accept credit and debit cards as well, however, due to the payment processing app’s high fees, we levy an additional
                charge per session. A unique link will be shared for each individual payment in case of payment via card.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Transactions within India:</h2>
            <p>The UPI number for payments for all sessions is <br><br><span class="font-medium">For Paytm/PhonePe/UPI/GPay:</span> +919205025183. <br><br><span class="font-medium">For Bank Transfer:</span><br>You can pay via bank transfer to the details below. <br><br>Account Holder: DIVIJA BHASIN<br> Account Number: 50200075118921<br> IFSC: HDFC0003687<br> Branch: CHUNA MANDI PAHARGANJ<br> Account Type: CURRENT<br><br> Please share the screenshot on our Instagram (@thefriendlycouch) or our WhatsApp (+919205025183) once you complete the transaction.</p>

                note that the screenshot is NOT to be shared with the therapist for confirmation as they’re not in charge of the
                verification process.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">RESCHEDULE POLICY</h2>
            <p>Sessions can only be rescheduled free of charge <span class="font-medium">up to 24 hours</span> (more than 24 hours) in advance. <br><br>In case of a
                reschedule or cancellation, the client must inform <span class="font-medium">BOTH</span> the therapist as well as the admin team <span class="font-medium">at least 24 hours</span> in
                advance. <br><br><span class="font-medium underline">NO REFUNDS</span> will be available if sessions are cancelled or rescheduled less than 24 hours prior to the
                session start time and the session will be considered as a last minute cancellation. <br><br>If the client <span class="font-medium">does not</span> join the
                session <span class="font-medium">within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time</span> , the session will be considered as a <span class="font-medium">no-show</span> and <span class="font-medium">no refunds/
                reschedules</span> will be possible. <br><br><span class="font-medium">A new slot will have to be booked and payment is to be made again to confirm the new
                slot.</span><br><br>In case of a reschedule from the therapist/ psychologist’s end, you will be informed in advance as well.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>The sessions will be completely confidential and private between you and the therapist. The only record of the
                session that will exist is any notes that the therapist takes as part of the process of therapy which is solely
                available to the therapist/ psychologist. No information including your name and number or any personal information
                will be shared with anyone without your explicit consent. <br><br>You agree to use a secure line/connection for these
                consultations, in a relatively quiet and private space. No audio or video recording of the session (either on
                mobile, using an app or online) is to be performed and the proceedings of this consultation are strictly
                confidential and must not be shared with any other individual or agency without explicit consent and prior
                notification. <br><br>You accept and understand that the proceedings of these consultations are not to be recorded, shared
                or disseminated by you or your relatives or any other individual to any third person or through social media.<br><br>However, despite safety measures taken, there are chances for breach in security in technology. In such instances, both
                client and psychotherapist will not hold the other responsible for the breach.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Mental Health Act</h2>
            <p>A person with mental illness shall have the right to confidentiality in respect of their mental health, mental
                healthcare, treatment and physical healthcare. <br><br>All health professionals providing care or treatment to a person with
                mental illness shall have a duty to keep all such information confidential which has been obtained during care or
                treatment with the following exceptions, namely: <br><br>(a) release of information to the nominated representative to
                enable them to fulfill their duties under this Act; <br><br>(b) release of information to other mental health professionals
                and other health professionals to enable them to provide care and treatment to the person with mental illness; <br><br>(c)
                release of information if it is necessary to protect any other person from harm or violence; <br><br>(d) only such
                information that is necessary to protect against the harm identified shall be released; <br><br>(e) release only such
                information as is necessary to prevent threat to life; <br><br>(f) release of information upon an order by concerned Board
                or the Central Authority or High Court or Supreme Court or any other statutory authority competent to do so; <br><br>(g)
                release of information in the interests of public safety and security; <br><br>(h) information accessible to the
                administration team of The Friendly Couch for smooth functioning of the organization; <br><br>(i) information accessible to
                supervisors of therapists to ensure quality of sessions is maintained for all clients.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Minors</h2>
            <p>If you are under 18 years of age, please be aware that the law may provide your parents the right to examine your
                treatment records. It is our policy to request that we will provide parents only with general information about our
                work together, unless we feel there is a high risk that you will seriously harm yourself or someone else. <br><br>In this
                case, we will notify them of our concerns. We will also provide them with a summary of your treatment when it is
                complete. Before giving them any information, we will discuss the matter with you, if possible, and do our best to
                handle any objections you may have about it. A letter of consent will be requested if the client is a minor. The
                letter of consent is to be signed by a legal adult who may or may not be their parent.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Duty to Warn</h2>
            <p>In the event that we reasonably believe that you are a danger, physically or emotionally, to yourself or another
                person, consent is given to us to warn the person in danger and to contact any person in a position to prevent harm
                to yourself or another person, including law enforcement and medical personnel.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Interaction beyond sessions</h2>
            <p>Our relationship will now be a professional and therapeutic one. In order to preserve this relationship, it is
                imperative that we do not have any other type of relationship with you. Personal and/or business relationships
                undermine the effectiveness of the therapeutic relationship. We care about helping you but are not in a position to
                be your friend or to have a social and personal relationship with you. Gifts, bartering, and trading services are
                strictly prohibited and must not be shared/ exchanged. <br><br>Therapy is a way for you to become independent and
                self-reliant. For this purpose, we will not be able to text or call outside of our sessions unless it is to discuss
                session timings. <br><br>Any information available on The Friendly Couch website/social media is not therapy and is only
                available for awareness. It is not a substitute for therapy or a helpline.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Consent to Transfer</h2>
            <p>By signing the consent form, you agree that you will not be taking therapy sessions with the therapist privately
                (i.e. making the payment to the therapist’s account without informing The Friendly Couch) during or beyond the
                duration of their affiliation with The Friendly Couch. In case The Friendly Couch discontinues working with a
                therapist, you consent to being transferred to another therapist on the team. <br><br>By signing the consent form, you
                consent for your notes to be transferred to a new therapist in case you wish to get transferred. For the same, you
                consent for The Friendly Couch to have access to your case notes which will be kept confidential and will not be
                shared with anyone outside the organization without your consent. <br><br>By signing the consent form, you understand that
                taking sessions with the therapist privately (as defined above) is against the legal contract between the therapist
                and The Friendly Couch. <br><br>This restriction is in place as the therapists are no longer obligated to follow The
                Friendly Couch’s code of professionalism and ethics once they leave the team. The Friendly Couch does not want any
                harm to be caused to the clients as The Friendly Couch can no longer monitor the quality of the therapist’s work
                once work is discontinued with them. This consent form will not apply to the therapist in case they are no longer an
                employee of The Friendly Couch. You will be informed about the same in case such a situation arises.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Length and number of sessions</h2>
            <p>The length of each session will be 60 minutes (one hour). <br><br>You may request for additional time in 30 minute (half an
                hour) increments or request for a double session (defined as 120 minutes/ two hours) if deemed necessary after your
                initial interactions with your therapist. <br><br>Any additional time beyond the defined 60 minutes (one hour) of scheduled
                session is chargeable. Additional charges for this will be communicated to you at the time of booking.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Consent to Treatment</h2>
            <p>A consent form will be shared with you before any therapy is initiated. The consent form is an agreement for
                treatment between you (the client) and The Friendly Couch. <br><br>By signing the consent form you voluntarily agree to
                receive mental health assessment, care, treatment, or services and authorize us to provide such care, treatment, or
                services as are considered necessary and advisable by The Friendly Couch. Signing the consent form indicates that
                you understand and agree that you will participate in the planning of your care, treatment, or services, and that
                you may stop such care, treatment, or services at any time. By signing the consent form, you acknowledge that you
                have both read and understood all the terms and information contained herein. <br><br>Therapists at The Friendly Couch
                reserve the right to discontinue therapy owing to their mental health and sense of security. Any person who displays
                lewd or indecent behavior or makes the staff feel uncomfortable or unsafe will not be provided the services.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Risks and Benefits of Therapy</h2>
            <p>Psychotherapy is a joint effort between the client(s) and the therapist. Progress and success may vary depending upon
                the particular problems or issues being addressed, as well as many other factors. Participating in therapy may
                result in a number of benefits, including, but not limited to, reduced stress and anxiety, increased ability to
                relate to others, a decrease in negative thoughts and self-sabotaging behaviors, improved interpersonal
                relationships, increased comfort in school, social, work, and family settings, increased capacity for intimacy, and
                increased self-confidence. Such benefits may also require substantial effort on the part of the client(s), including
                an active participation in the therapeutic process, honesty, and a willingness to change feelings, thoughts and
                behaviors. There is no guarantee that therapy will yield any or all of the benefits listed above. <br><br>Participating in
                therapy may also involve some discomfort, including remembering and discussing unpleasant events, feelings and
                experiences. The process may evoke strong feelings of sadness, anger, fear, etc. There may be times in which
                clients' perceptions and assumptions are challenged, and different perspectives offered. The issues presented by
                clients may result in unintended outcomes, including changes in personal relationships. Clients should be aware that
                any decision on the status of his/her personal relationships is your responsibility. During the therapeutic process,
                many clients find that they feel worse before they feel better. This is generally a normal course of events.
                Personal growth and change may be easy and swift at times, but may also be slow and frustrating.
                You may address any concerns you have regarding progress during your session. If you are the parent/representative of a
                client, there are limits to what will and will not be discussed in the course of treatment. These expectations will be
                clarified with you before treatment begins.
            </p>
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Harm to Oneself</h2>
            <p>Suicide, or ending one’s own life, is a tragic event with strong emotional repercussions for its survivors & for
                families of its victims. Every therapist’s attempt is to prevent such an unfortunate event from occurring. However,
                it is an impulsive act & under such unpredictable circumstances, a therapist or The Friendly Couch cannot be held
                liable for it. <br><br>It is important to note that The Friendly Couch is not a crisis intervention center & therefore does
                not provide emergency services. Services are rendered only during the scheduled sessions. Clients who have an
                emergency must use local & available emergency resources.</p>
            
            <h2 class=" pt-10 pb-3 text-xl font-medium uppercase">Participation in Litigation</h2>
            <p>We will not voluntarily participate in any litigation, or custody dispute in which client and another individual, or
                entity, are parties. We have a policy of not communicating with client’s attorney and will generally not write or
                sign letters, reports, declarations, or affidavits to be used in a legal matter unless agreed upon at the beginning
                of the therapeutic relationship. We will generally not provide records or testimony unless compelled to do so.
                Should we be subpoenaed, or ordered by a court of law, to appear as a witness in an action involving a client; the
                client agrees to reimburse us for any time spent or preparation, travel, or other time in which we have made
                ourselves available for such an appearance at our usual and customary fees. <br><br>The Friendly Couch is not to be held
                liable for any criminal actions conducted by therapists working at The Friendly Couch.</p>
